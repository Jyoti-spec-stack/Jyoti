# Jyoti Mishra - Data-Driven Product Leader 

## The Journey: From 0-1 Products to Scalable Impact

I am a Product Manager with over 9 years of experience in SaaS, e-commerce, and marketplaces, specializing in building and scaling high-impact products. My expertise lies in growth, retention, automation, and data-driven decision-making.

## A 6-Year MBA at Urban Company 

While I don’t have a formal MBA, my six years at Urban Company were nothing short of an on-the-ground, high-intensity business school experience. From building 0-1 products to scaling them 10x, I learned how to optimize retention, pricing, and service models while balancing P&L, customer engagement, and automation at scale.

This hands-on experience shaped my approach to product management:
-  Deeply understanding customer pain points
-  Iterating rapidly with data-backed decisions
-  Automating processes to enhance efficiency
-  Aligning cross-functional teams to execute with speed

## How I Acquired My Product Management Skills 

My PM journey was shaped by solving real-world problems, driving business impact, and learning on the go:

- **Urban Company (6 Years)**: Here, I learned end-to-end business ownership—balancing user needs, operational efficiency, and revenue growth. Managing P&L, retention, and service delivery taught me how to scale products sustainably.
- **Infra.Market (1 Year)**: Built 0-1 digital procurement solutions, learning how to optimize acquisition, engagement, and pricing models in a fast-paced B2B environment.
- **Vistaprint (2 Years)**: Led e-commerce & design automation, honing skills in conversion optimization, funnel analysis, and UX improvements to drive higher engagement and revenue.

This blend of B2C, B2B, e-commerce, and marketplace experience has given me a holistic, adaptable product mindset—allowing me to drive impact across diverse domains.
